  abstract  = {The development of mobile applications has become a means to improve the quality of life of older adults since it is possible to apply to various sectors such as medicine, for example. Also, the population aged 60 or above is growing at a rate of about 3 percent per year. Currently, rapid ageing will occur in different parts of the world as well, so that by 2050 all regions of the world except Africa will have nearly a quarter or more of their populations at ages 60 and above [45]. Likewise, it is known that older people require more time to complete tasks on mobile devices [4] and presents usability problems, so the generic developments of mobile applications do not adapt to their needs and special characteristics. For this reason, this paper addresses which are the main usability challenges that adults face when they interact with de user graphic interface of an application and how they can be made more acceptable to the target population. We summarize the relevant issues in three potential causes: visual, psychomotor and cognitive limitations. In the first category we found problems as the size and sharpness for the visual elements such characters, icons, images, charts and buttons. Also, use hard colors or inappropriate contrast color for the elements represents a significant problem to the seniors. On other hand, we found that the demand for fast and repetitive movements for interaction like moving texts or targets, the maximization in the required number of steps to complete a task and the use of scrollbars represent inconveniences in the second category for the elderly. Finally, in the last category, the most relevant issues are the use of non-significant and irrelevant graphics, or non-meaningful icons with decoration, animation or with no concise text description that goes with it. Besides, use complex texts and navigating through deep, complex and expandable menu hierarchies causes that older persons getting lost within the device menu.},

  abstract = {Technology in the field of health care has taken a step forward for making health maintenance easy on a daily basis. With a gradual increase in the elderly population, it is important to provide them with facilities made accessible through technological innovations. But it is observed that the elderly show reluctance to the use of new technology such as mobile applications. In this paper, an effort is made to overcome this barrier with the study of both elderly user experiences and user interface design of an mHealth application and an analysis of the relation between them.}
